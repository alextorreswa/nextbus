## **Project Background & Purpose**
### **Overview / Elevator Pitch:**
The NextBus project aims to simplify bus schedule accessibility for Community Transit users. Passengers can scan QR codes at bus stops to access real-time schedules and estimated arrival times. The added speech function enhances usability for individuals with language preferences or visual impairments. This project addresses passenger pain points with printed schedules and improves overall commuter convenience.

### **Goals & Objectives:**
- **Specific:** Develop a web app providing real-time bus schedule information via QR codes.  
- **Measurable:** Ensure QR codes are available at 100% of designated bus stops.  
- **Achievable:** Utilize existing schedule data and APIs for development.  
- **Relevant:** Address accessibility issues and user frustration with outdated schedules.  
- **Time-Bound:** Complete the project within 10 weeks.
