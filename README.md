# Web Application for Community Transit Bus Schedules

## Executive Summary
This project aims to develop a **web application** that provides real-time bus arrival information for **Community Transit** routes. Users can scan **QR codes** at each stop to access updated schedules and estimated arrival times, with an added speech function that reads bus times in the user's preferred phone language.

### Why is this project important?
Many bus stops display printed schedules, but passengers often struggle to interpret the information‚Äîespecially differentiating between **AM/PM times or weekday/weekend schedules**. Not all stops have **real-time digital signage**, making it difficult for users to plan effectively. This web app **solves these challenges** by providing a **simplified, accessible, and real-time solution**.

## Goals and Objectives
### SMART Goals:
- **Specific** ‚Äì Develop a web app that provides bus arrival data based on time, stop location, and schedule.
- **Measurable** ‚Äì Ensure 100% of designated bus stops have QR codes linked to the app.
- **Achievable** ‚Äì Leverage existing bus schedule data and public APIs to build a reliable system.
- **Relevant** ‚Äì Address passenger pain points by improving accessibility and reducing confusion.
- **Time-Bound** ‚Äì Complete development and testing within **10 weeks** and deploy for user feedback.

## Scope Statement
### **Included**:
‚úÖ Development of a **web app** with a database filtering bus routes based on time, stop, and date.  
‚úÖ **QR codes** at bus stops for easy schedule access.  
‚úÖ A **speech function** that reads bus times in the user‚Äôs preferred phone language.  
‚úÖ Integration with **Community Transit schedules** for accurate data.  

### **Excluded**:
‚ùå Physical **electronic displays** at stops.  
‚ùå A **mobile app** (this is a web-based solution).  
‚ùå **Live GPS tracking** of buses (focus is on schedule information).

## Risk Management Plan
### **Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies**
- **Lack of data access** ‚Üí Schedule meetings with CT managers early to ensure transparency.
- **Existing similar projects** ‚Üí Confirm CT isn‚Äôt already developing a similar service.
- **Speech functionality limitations** ‚Üí Research free/open-source text-to-speech libraries.

---

## Communication Plan
- **Tracking:** Personal journal & checklist for progress.
- **Updates:** Contact stakeholders for feedback.
- **User engagement:** Recruit testers from regular bus passengers.

---

## Success Metrics
‚úÖ Web app successfully deployed and accessible via QR codes.  
‚úÖ Bus schedules correctly displayed and spoken in different languages.  
‚úÖ Positive feedback from initial user testing.


## Final Thoughts
This project combines **data accessibility, transportation needs, and technology** to enhance bus passenger experiences. The solution is **scalable, cost-effective, and practical**, improving **commuter convenience**. üöçüí°
